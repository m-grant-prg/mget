Release 1.0.6 2013-08-22
Debian best practice documentation requires that programs placed in
the PATH should not have extensions as the programs may be rewritten
in a different language. This would then require a name change, or,
if left as-is would cause confusion. So name changed to remove .sh
extension.

Release 1.0.5 2013-05-05
Fixed ugly exit if 'sourcefile' = "" or 'targetdir' = "". 'targetdir' is now
defaulted to 'PWD'.

Release 1.0.4 2013-05-03
Included source and target information in script output to be more useful.

Release 1.0.3 2013-05-02
Introduced -q option to utilise fetch or wget quiet mode.

Release 1.0.2 2013-04-30
Fixed incorrect display of Error Status in man page. Introduced source file
processing to ensure it has Unix type line endings. Removed partial
implementation of 'MailTo' functionality.

Release 1.0.1 2013-04-29
First release. Does not implement mail notification.
