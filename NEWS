Improved directory structure in source and which files Git tracks. Added configure check for txt2man.

Release 1.0.12 2014-01-06
Persist option code was in the file processing loop and never got executed if no
files were to be processed. Moved out of loop.

Release 1.0.11 2014-01-05
Introduced new standardised error handler routine to test previous command
success. Changed command line options to use -V	as the version option, S as
Source URL and -T as target directory. Introduced -q, -s & -v as quiet, silent
and verbose options. Fixed error handling on existing file deletion.

Release 1.0.10 2014-01-01
Tidied up use of output function.

Changed so that output function is the only place to insert the program name

Changed stdout & stderr message output to use a function directing to one or
other based on a status.

Release 1.0.6 2013-08-22
Debian best practice documentation requires that programs placed in
the PATH should not have extensions as the programs may be rewritten
in a different language. This would then require a name change, or,
if left as-is would cause confusion. So name changed to remove .sh
extension.

Release 1.0.5 2013-05-05
Fixed ugly exit if 'sourcefile' = "" or 'targetdir' = "". 'targetdir' is now
defaulted to 'PWD'.

Release 1.0.4 2013-05-03
Included source and target information in script output to be more useful.

Release 1.0.3 2013-05-02

implementation of 'MailTo' functionality.

First release. Does not implement mail notification.
