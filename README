1 ... Project Description
=========================

This AutoTools project contains a file downloader system.

mget downloads 1 or more files whose URL's are specified in a file whose
filename is given as a command line argument. The downloaded files are placed in
a specified target directory. The source file and target directory can be saved
to a config file and these values will be used in future if values are not
specified on the command line.

If a text file is being downloaded, a conversion to Unix or Windows line endings
can be specified on the command line.

For further information please look at the man page or mget --help.

This script lends itself to being used with cron.

Example
-------
Create a file eg /home/mgrant/Downloads/download-requests.txt

Place the following URL's in it:-
https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/policy.txt
https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/google_privacy_policy_en.pdf

Save the file.

Type 'mget -S /home/mgrant/Downloads/download-requests.txt \
	-T /home/mgrant/Downloads \
	--persist'
and check the result.

If you now modify the contents of the request file you could:-
Type 'mget'
and it will use the saved values of source file and target directory.
